This is a simple plant-watering system using arduino to drive a small peristaltic pump.

* Based on instructables design

* Calibration

In the initial timing test, it took the pump *21 minutes* to move *1 liter* of
water. The water moved through 5m of tubing with the pump in approx. the middle
of the run.
